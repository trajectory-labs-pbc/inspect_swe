"""Wait for bridge MCP endpoints to actually serve tools, from inside the sandbox.

The bridge proxy starts asynchronously, so its MCP endpoints may not be
listening yet at the moment an agent subprocess is launched. Agents that
connect to MCP servers synchronously at startup will then come up with NO MCP
tools and — critically — will not report an error: they simply behave as though
the tools do not exist. This is a silent-failure mode, so every agent launch
that depends on bridged MCP tools should gate on this.

Reachability is not readiness. The bridge serves `/mcp/{name}` from the
in-sandbox proxy, but only `tools/list` crosses back to the host, and that hop
is a file-based RPC the proxy polls with no timeout. So the endpoint answers
long before the host can answer a tool listing, and a bodyless probe cannot
tell the two apart: the proxy replies to an unknown JSON-RPC method with a
well-formed error carried over **HTTP 200**, which any `curl -f` treats as
success. Under load an agent whose own MCP startup timer is bounded then gives
up on a server this gate just declared ready, and the sample proceeds toolless.

So the probe here is a real `tools/list` and the success condition is that at
least one of the tools the bridge is *supposed* to serve for that server comes
back. That exercises the whole path the agent depends on -- proxy, file RPC,
host service -- and leaves it warm before the agent's timer starts.

    Polls each endpoint with a real JSON-RPC ``tools/list`` and requires a

    listening endpoint is not enough: only ``tools/list`` crosses to the host,
    so it is the only probe that proves the agent will actually receive tools
    (see module docstring).

    Args:
      configs: Bridged HTTP MCP configs to gate on. Any config whose bridge
        registry entry is empty is skipped: a zero-tool bridge is a valid
        configuration, and probing it forever would fail a healthy gate.
      bridge: The sandbox agent bridge whose ``bridged_tools`` registry is
        the source of truth for what ``tools/list`` should return. The gate
        succeeds for a server as soon as any expected tool comes back.
      sandbox: The sandbox environment the agent will run in, or its name.
        Passed through to ``inspect_ai.util.sandbox`` resolution. Must match
        the sandbox the caller uses to create the bridge and launch the
        CLI, otherwise the probe runs in the wrong container -- typically
        the task's default env when the agent's is different -- and either
        waits out the full timeout or validates an unrelated listener.
      timeout: Total wall-clock seconds to wait across all endpoints. Probe
        runtime counts against this deadline: with hanging probes, an outer
        computation that fixed ``remaining`` once could run well past the
        advertised deadline, so it is recomputed before every probe.
      interval: Seconds to sleep between poll passes.
      required: Raise on timeout when true (default). False returns ``False``
        instead of raising; callers should have a specific reason to opt out,
        because proceeding past an unready endpoint means launching an agent
        that will silently have no tools.

    Returns:
      True once every configured endpoint serves at least one expected tool,
      or the configs list is empty / every server has zero expected tools.

    Raises:
      MCPProbeExecutableMissingError: ``curl`` cannot be executed in the
        sandbox. Raised on the first probe, not after ``timeout``, so a
        misconfigured image fails visibly instead of after two silent minutes.
      MCPEndpointsUnreachableError: ``timeout`` elapsed with at least one
        endpoint still unready and ``required`` is true.
