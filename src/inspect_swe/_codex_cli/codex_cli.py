    """Codex CLI.

    Agent that uses OpenAI [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) running in a sandbox.

    Use the `attempts` option to enable additional submissions if the initial
    submission(s) are incorrect (by default, no additional attempts are permitted).

    Args:
        name: Agent name (used in multi-agent systems with `as_tool()` and `handoff()`)
        description: Agent description (used in multi-agent systems with `as_tool()` and `handoff()`)
        system_prompt: Additional system prompt to append to default system prompt.
        model_config: Codex model slug used to select the system prompt and tool
            set. Defaults to `None`, which derives the slug from the real model so
            Codex's prompt/tooling aligns with what's actually running. Pass an
            explicit slug to override.
        skills: Additional [skills](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tools-standard.html#sec-skill) to make available to the agent.
        mcp_servers: MCP servers to make available to the agent.
        bridged_tools: Host-side Inspect tools to expose to the agent via MCP.
            Each BridgedToolsSpec creates an MCP server that makes the specified
            tools available to the agent running in the sandbox.
        mcp_ready_timeout: Seconds to wait for bridged MCP endpoints to serve
            tools before the agent launch errors.
        web_search: Web search mode. Use "live" for live web search, "cached" for cached web search, or "disabled" to disable web search. Defaults to "live".
        goals: Enable Codex goal tools (defaults to `True`).
        auto_review: Enable Codex automated approval review (guardian). When enabled,
            Codex runs with its own sandbox active (`workspace-write`) and `on-request`
            approvals; escalation requests (e.g. network access, writes outside the
            workspace) are adjudicated by a guardian model rather than auto-approved.
            Pass `CodexAutoReview` to customize the guardian policy and model.
            Requires Codex CLI >= 0.137.0. Defaults to `False`.
        centaur: Run in 'centaur' mode, which makes Codex CLI available to an Inspect `human_cli()` agent rather than running it unattended.
        attempts: Configure agent to make multiple attempts. When this is specified, the task will be scored when the agent stops calling tools. If the scoring is successful, execution will stop. Otherwise, the agent will be prompted to pick up where it left off for another attempt.
        model: Model name to use (defaults to main model for task).
        model_aliases: Optional mapping of model names to Model instances or model name strings.
            Allows using custom Model implementations (e.g., wrapped Agents) instead of standard models.
            When a model name in the mapping is referenced, the corresponding Model/string is used.
        transparent_proxy: Retain the model identity and generation configuration
            requested by the agent instead of using the bridge alias table or
            fallback model (supports agents' internal model calls that must reach
            their intended provider model).
        filter: Filter for intercepting bridged model requests.
        retry_refusals: Should refusals be retried? (pass number of times to retry)
        home_dir: Home directory to use for codex cli. If set, AGENTS.md, skills, and the MCP configuration will be written here.
        cwd: Working directory to run codex cli within.
        env: Environment variables to set for codex cli
        user: User to execute codex cli with.
        sandbox: Optional sandbox environment name.
        version: Version of codex cli to use. One of:
            - "auto": Use any available version of codex cli in the sandbox, otherwise download the latest version.
            - "sandbox": Use the version of codex cli in the sandbox (raises `RuntimeError` if codex is not available in the sandbox)
            - "latest": Download and use the very latest version of codex cli.
            - "x.x.x": Download and use a specific version of codex cli.
        config_overrides: Additional Codex CLI configuration overrides.
            Each key-value pair is passed as `-c key=value` to the CLI, except
            `approval_policy` and `sandbox_mode`, which are intercepted and
            validated (invalid values raise `ValueError`) so that command
            construction and the bridged-MCP configuration are derived from one
            effective value rather than silently disagreeing with the raw flag.
        debug: Trace all debug output.
        sandbox_mode: Codex's own sandbox policy for model-generated shell commands
            (`-s`/`--sandbox`), not related to the `sandbox` option above that selects
            an Inspect sandbox environment. Defaults to `"danger-full-access"`, which
            combined with `approval_policy="never"` (the default) reproduces the
            original `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` behavior.

            The restricted modes run Codex's Linux sandbox, which on current codex
            releases requires a system `bwrap` (bubblewrap) binary in the sandbox
            image -- the codex release archive ships only the codex binary, so no
            bundled fallback exists, and codex panics at shell launch without it
            (this agent fails fast with an actionable error instead). The container
            runtime must also permit unprivileged user namespace creation; Docker's
            default seccomp profile does not. The mechanism is version-dependent:
            codex <= 0.77 used Landlock+seccomp (no bwrap), 0.98 had bwrap opt-in.

            Mode semantics for model-generated commands (the Codex parent process
            contacts MCP servers and the model proxy outside this sandbox):
            `"read-only"` blocks writes AND network, and with the default
            `approval_policy="never"` denies writes outright with no approval path
            (the agent cannot edit anything). `"workspace-write"` makes cwd, `/tmp`
            and `$TMPDIR` writable, but remounts top-level `.git` (and
            `.agents`/`.codex`) in each writable root read-only -- model-run
            `git commit`/`checkout`/`stash` fail (flip side: the agent cannot tamper
            with its own `.codex` CODEX_HOME).
        approval_policy: Codex's approval policy (`AskForApproval`). Defaults to
            `"never"`. Under headless `codex exec` (the default), codex itself
            overrides the runtime policy to `never` regardless of this setting
            (verified on codex 0.42.0 through 0.145.0), so a non-`"never"` value
            without an approvals reviewer raises `ValueError` here rather than
            silently breaking bridged tools. Prompting policies are effective in
            centaur mode, or headless with
            `config_overrides={"approvals_reviewer": ...}` (codex's auto-review
            escape hatch).
        network_access: Whether Codex's `"workspace-write"` sandbox may access the
            network for model-generated commands. Defaults to `True` -- note this
            inverts Codex's own default (`false`) to preserve continuity with the
            previous unconditional full-access behavior; ignored by other sandbox
            modes. `config_overrides={"sandbox_workspace_write.network_access":
            "false"}` also wins over this setting (later `-c` pairs take
            precedence in codex).
        approve_static_mcp_tools: Also pre-approve tool calls from static
            `mcp_servers` (not just Inspect-bridged servers) when the effective
            approval policy is `"never"`. Defaults to `False`: static servers keep
            Codex's per-server default gate. Note that under the restricted
            sandbox modes that default cancels un-annotated static tool calls
            headlessly (inspect's `MCPServerConfig` cannot express
            `default_tools_approval_mode`), so set this to `True` if you combine
            `sandbox_mode` with static `mcp_servers`.
