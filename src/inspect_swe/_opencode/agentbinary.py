    them; we install host-side, before any in-sandbox probe ever runs, and
    can't reliably read the underlying host's CPU flags from out here — the
    sandbox may be scheduled onto a different physical host than the one
    that eventually runs the binary, and some sandbox providers don't expose
    real CPU flags at all. We deliberately prefer the baseline asset on
    every x64 platform: it trades a little performance on modern hosts for
    never staging a binary that SIGILLs on any host predating AVX2 (~2013),
    which is the safer default for sandbox portability. arm64 has no
