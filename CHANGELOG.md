## 0.2.65 (05 July 2026)

- Codex CLI and Claude Code: Support checkpointing and resuming runs via `checkpointer()`, restoring session/attempt state across resumes.
- Claude Code: Handle Anthropic refusals gracefully — a content-filter refusal now scores the sample as incorrect and continues the eval (matching native Inspect solvers) instead of raising an error that aborts the run.
- Gemini CLI (ACP): Register bridged tools and MCP servers with the CLI (write `settings.json` and pass `--allowed-mcp-server-names`) so host-side tools are available to the agent.
- All agents: When no `cwd` is specified and the sandbox's default working directory is `/` (i.e. the image has no `WORKDIR`), run the agent in the user's home directory instead of the container root.

## 0.2.63 (10 June 2026)

- Remove ACP patch for connection initialization order issue (resolved in ACP 0.10.1).
- Codex CLI: Resolve "stable"/"latest" via the GitHub `releases/latest` endpoint — the full releases listing for openai/codex frequently 504s.

## 0.2.62 (05 June 2026)

- Claude Code: Present the real served model as the agent's own identity (e.g. its "You are powered by the model …" system prompt) instead of the bridge sentinel. Added a `model_config` parameter to override the presented identity.
- Claude Code: `opus_model` / `sonnet_model` / `haiku_model` / `subagent_model` are now actually honored — previously the bridge fallback collapsed them onto a single model.
- Tracing: Only trace full session output when `debug` option is passed.

## 0.2.61 (03 June 2026)

- Claude Code: Fix system prompt being re-sent on resumed turns.
- Codex CLI: Align `OpenAIAPI`-derived custom providers by their declared `service_model_name()`.
- Codex CLI: Fall back to a bundled model catalog when the version-matched `models.json` can't be fetched.

## 0.2.60 (02 June 2026)

- Update Inspect AI dependency to 0.3.234

## 0.2.59 (31 May 2026)

- Codex CLI: Detect and apply agent spans automatically from Codex event stream.

## 0.2.57 (30 May 2026)

- Codex CLI: Align the system prompt and tool set with the real bridged model. `model_config` now defaults to `None`, deriving Codex's `--model` slug from the actual model. Pass an explicit `model_config` to override.
- Codex CLI: Add options for enabling/disabling `web_search` and `goals` tools (both default to enabled).
- Codex CLI: Improve MCP tests to check for correct tool names and assert results.
- Gemini CLI: Explicity set auth type to "gemini-api-key" (required for recent versions of the CLI).

## 0.2.56 (25 May 2026)

- OpenCode: Install ripgrep for access to native skills.
- Claude Code: Improved live event capture (no longer requires injection of spans into transcript).
