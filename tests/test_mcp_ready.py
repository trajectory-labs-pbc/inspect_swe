"""Regression tests for MCP readiness gating on agent (re)launch.

Context: the claude_code retry loop restarts the Claude Code subprocess with
``--resume``. The bridge proxy starts asynchronously, so its MCP endpoints may
not be reachable at that moment. A resumed session that comes up without its
MCP tools fails SILENTLY: the agent sees "No such tool available", produces an
empty response, and the sample is scored as an ordinary toolless trajectory with
no error field set. Measured in production: 209 samples across six collection
arms, with a session restart preceding every one.

The gate probes ``tools/list`` rather than merely opening a connection, because
reachability and readiness are different facts here: the in-sandbox proxy serves
``/mcp/{name}`` immediately, but only ``tools/list`` crosses to the host, and the
proxy answers an unknown JSON-RPC method with a well-formed error over HTTP 200.
A status-code probe therefore passes while the agent still receives nothing. The
tests below pin that distinction.

These drive coroutines via ``anyio.run`` rather than a pytest async plugin, so
they need no new test dependency or pytest configuration.
