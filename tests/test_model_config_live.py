"""End-to-end tests that the inner agent presents the genuine served-model identity.

Runs Claude Code in a real sandbox and captures its first bridged request via a
``GenerateFilter``. The bridge hands the filter Claude Code's system prompt (which
contains the "# Environment ... You are powered by the model X" block) plus the
resolved Inspect ``Model`` — so we can assert what the *underlying model* sees,
the eval-awareness surface this change targets.

Claude Code builds the identity block from an internal catalog: a recognized
Anthropic id renders the genuine "You are powered by the model named <Friendly>.
The exact model ID is <id>." (plus a knowledge-cutoff line), canonicalizing
dated / ``[1m]`` / provider-prefixed variants via substring match. An
unrecognized id (cross-provider, or a Claude model newer than the installed
Claude Code) honestly degrades to "You are powered by the model <id>." with no
fabricated Claude identity. So we assert:

- a native Anthropic model yields the *genuine* block — NOT the bridge sentinel
  ``inspect`` (the regression this change fixes) and NOT a degraded raw echo;
- a dated Anthropic id still yields the genuine friendly name — Claude Code
  normalizes internally, so no normalization is needed on our side;
- a cross-provider model honestly degrades (no fabricated Claude identity);
- ``model_config`` overrides the presented identity without changing routing;
- bridged routing still resolves to the served model in every case.

Slow: requires Docker + a live model API (mirrors ``tests/test_codex_align.py``).
