"""End-to-end coverage for the native Antigravity CLI (`agy`) agent.

`tests/test_antigravity_cli_config.py` and
`tests/test_antigravity_cli_error_reporting.py` cover the on-disk configuration
and the failure-reporting helper as pure units. Neither runs the CLI, so neither
can catch the launch itself not working: a flag the binary rejects, a settings
key that no longer selects the direct-Gemini route, or a tool call that reaches
the CLI and executes nothing.

The two round-trip tests here run the pinned binary for real. Only the *model* is
scripted -- via the keyless `mockllm` provider, so no Google credentials and no
network generation are involved -- and it is reached through the real
`sandbox_agent_bridge` over loopback, exactly as a live run reaches a real
model. The CLI, its tools, the bridge and the sandbox are all genuine.

The first has the CLI execute its own `run_command` tool to write and read back
a harmless fixture file, asserted against that file's real content in the
sandbox. The second exposes a host-side Inspect tool over the bridge's MCP
endpoint and has the CLI call it, asserted against that host tool's real return
value arriving back in the sandbox.

Both scripted argument sets are the ones the pinned CLI's own declarations mark
required: `CommandLine`, `Cwd`, `WaitMsBeforeAsync`, `toolAction` and
`toolSummary` for `run_command`; the tool's own `message` plus `toolSummary`
and `toolAction` for the bridged tool, which the CLI declares under a
server-qualified name of its own making rather than the host's. Omitting a
required key, or using the host-side name, is rejected before the tool runs.

Three further Docker tests inspect the launch rather than run one. They install
the pinned binary for real and capture what the agent builds -- the command,
the environment it carries and the settings file it writes -- to pin which
controls belong to the unattended path, which of them are withheld from the
command a human is handed in centaur mode, and that a disabled reasoning effort
is really left off. They are launch-contract inspections, not native proof:
the unattended two stop the run at the launch rather than let a CLI that never
ran appear to have produced a result. `effort=None` cannot be a real launch at
all -- the CLI's default model rejects the flag's absence -- which is the same
reason these are inspections.

A last test covers the shared agent-binary tooling and needs neither Docker nor
the network.
