"""Fast unit tests for Claude Code model identity + bridge-alias resolution.

Uses the keyless ``mockllm`` provider so these run without Docker or API keys
(unlike ``tests/test_model_config_live.py``). Covers the per-role alias routing
and ``model_config`` override logic in ``resolve_claude_code_models``.
