"""The suite must not write into the developer's home directory.

Agent binaries, wheels, node and ripgrep resolve their download directory through
`appdirs.package_cache_dir`, which `mkdir(parents=True)`s eagerly — so merely *resolving*
a path creates it. Tests that mock an installer but not the resolution still wrote
`~/.cache/inspect_swe/...`, and `minisweagent` created `~/.config/mini-swe-agent` at
import. `tests/conftest.py` redirects both; these tests fail if either redirect is
removed.
